Heramb - HW4 - line chart - Tableau

## Explanation

Below are the steps taken to recreate the image in tableau.

  - The above chart is a line chart with multiple lines where *marks*
    are **dots connected by lines** and **Vertical and horizontal
    spatial positions of attributes** are the *channels*. The data
    consists of *one quantitative attribute*(***percent of families with
    at least one member unemployed***) and *one ordered
    attribute*(***years***).

  - After loading the data into the tableau and creating a worksheet, go
    to the worksheet, drag and drop the *measure values* field in
    ***rows*** and *year* field in ***columns***. This will generate the
    line graph with multiple lines.

  - To get different colors for different lines, drag and drop the
    measure names field into color in marks card.

  - To change the color of each line to resemble the original chart,
    click on the color in the marks option and click on the â€™edit
    colors\` button, this will show us the edit colors window where we
    can assign the colors to each label.

  - To get labels on the graph, drag and drop the `measure names` field
    into the label in the `marks` card. We can change the alignment of
    the label by clicking it on once and dragging and dropping the label
    in a desired place on the graph.

  - To get the same label color, font as in original image, click on the
    `label` in the `marks` card, click on the `font` and click on the
    `Match mark color` button. This changes the color of the label to
    the same as that of the line.

  - Update the title with the same text as in the original chart by
    clicking on the `edit title`.

  - The font I have used is *Calibri* for the whole chart as it was
    similar to the one used in the original one. below are the different
    font sizes I have used for this chart.
    
      - Title: 28
      - Subtitle: 16
      - Label: 14
