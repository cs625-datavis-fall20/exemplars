# Caroline - small multiples line charts - R

## Explanation

The first thing I did was to reformat the data. The original data set
had columns for White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic. I merged those 4
columns into a single column called Race. This was so that I would be
able to set Race as a dimension for grouping. I also had to mutate the
Year data points so that they could be used as dates.

Next, I defined my colors. I used Paintâ€™s eyedropper tool to find the
hex code for the colors used.

The main challenge for this chart was figuring out how to do small
multiples using R. I found a function called facet\_grid which did this
for me automatically, so it was very easy to do.

After this, it was all a matter of formatting. I used two different
geom\_text statements to place the starting and ending data labels so
that I could position them correctly in relation to the line. The rest
is pretty straightforward setting font sizes, formatting dates and
labels, etc.
